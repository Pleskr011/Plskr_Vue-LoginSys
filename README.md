Vue3 Frontend for the LoginSys Backend. Just to give a visual to the backend project.

Things that need to be fixed:

- Footbar doesnÂ´t stay in the bottom of the page
- MFA doesn't get sent by pressing enter like login does
- Modify the lorem ipsum text to an actual welcome text
- Add more style to the logged component.
- Add the neccessary components when a new backend feature is added.
